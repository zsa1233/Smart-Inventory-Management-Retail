Smart Inventory Management for Retail (Electronics)

Why this project?
This project was created to learn and demonstrate how to build a modern, cloud-based inventory management system for electronics retail. The goal was to automate inventory tracking, forecasting, and restocking using real-world tools and cloud services.

Main Tools & Technologies
- AWS (SageMaker, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, SNS, API Gateway, QuickSight)
- Python (for backend, data simulation, and automation)
- React + Material-UI (for the admin web UI)

How it was deployed
1. Simulated sales and inventory data was generated using Python scripts.
2. AWS resources were set up: S3 for storage, DynamoDB for inventory, SageMaker for forecasting, Lambda for automation, SNS for alerts, API Gateway for secure API access, and QuickSight for dashboards.
3. The backend logic (including automation and alerts) was deployed as AWS Lambda functions.
4. The React admin UI was built and connected to the backend via API Gateway endpoints.

This project is a learning and demonstration tool for cloud-native inventory management using real AWS services and a modern web frontend.
